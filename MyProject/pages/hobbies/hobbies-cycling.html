            <h2>My favorite bike tours</h2>
            <p> I still remember with great pleasure, it was a summer day in 2015, a notification from Facebook appeared on my
                phone. Lucian Mandruta pedals with 500 cyclists from Bucharest to Navodari. I knew immediately that I had to do
                this too, although the distance between the two cities was around 300 km. I thought it might be hard for me, I
                hadn't cycled in 10 years, even so, I don't think I've ever cycled 20 km in one lap. However, I thought I had to
                do it!</p>
            <p> The following week I bought a bicycle and participated for the first time in the critical table, an event
                organized monthly by the "Brasovul Pedaleaza" group. I quickly integrated into the group, so I managed to
                participate in other private tours. I really liked the bike and since then I have cycled thousands of km every
                year.</p>
            <p> Of course, in 2016 I participated in the “Bicycle at Sea” event organized by Lucian Mandruta and I didn't stop
                here, it was too beautiful in 2016 that I couldn't miss the 2017 tour.</p>
            <p> Later, a group was formed made up of "Brasovul Pedaleaza" members who frequently participate in weekend tours. At
                first we cycled outside the city and even in Brasov county. Then we expanded the horizon a bit, we started to
                organize tours for a few days in other regions of the country, such as Maramures, Bucovina and Harghita.</p>
            <p> We didn't stop here, we started to cross the Romanian border. The first time, my colleagues went to Balaton Lake
                for a few days in Hungary. Unfortunately, I was not able to participate in this tour due to the busy
                schedule at work. But I participated in the most beautiful tour so far for me, five days along the Danube from
                Germany to Austria. In the five days, I cycled 400 km through rain and wind, then through the sun, passing
                through places I would never have seen otherwise
                and all this with these wonderful people from the group I told you about above.</p>
            <p> Before the pandemic, we were preparing to organize another tour in Greece. Unfortunately, it could not be done,
                but certainly after this pandemic situation passes, we will start pedaling again to wonderful new locations.</p>
